All ya gotta do to use this widget, open up OBS, go into the scene you want it to be in. Then make a browser source and put in this URL: http://mcsrrankedwidget.vercel.app/(YOUR USERNAME HERE) and hit OK.

To fix the allignment, you can hold ALT and drag the bottom right red box to the bottom right corner of the overlay so its matched up.
